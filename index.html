            <h2>Main idea</h2>
            Find out SLA of the AWS services you rely on, and add redundancy to minimise
            the risk of downtime where it will give you the impact.
            <h2> Optimise for $cost/%downtime</h2>

            Application Load Balancer ?
            <h3>let's hope not</h3>
            <small>It's a managed service by AWS, that shouldn't fail, however they don't say anything about SLAs or if we should expect this to fail...... weird</small>

            NAT Gateway ?
            <h1>nope</h1>

            <h3>Go multi region</h3>
            Run the same reference stack in a different region.
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Go multi provider</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Switch to Kubernetes or Docker Swarm</li>
              <li>Profit</li>
              <li>Make sure your non managed load balancers and orchestrators are not SPOFs</li>

            <h2>Tip #1</h2>
            Think about the cost
          </section>
          <section>
            Don't make your personal blog multi-region if you don't have to.

            Unless you're doing it for fun.
          </section>
          <section>
            Remember the eu-east-1 S3 failure that took down many things among them Docker Hub ?
          </section>
          <section>
            S3 is not supposed to fail (lol), but they could very easily have been multi region.

            (pic of the AWS console multi-region setting)
          </section>
          <section>
            But docker hub is a free service (the paid version didn't go down) and why would they pay
            twice the hosting cost to not be down for 8 hours in 3 years ?

        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>Tip #2</h2>
            break it

          <section>
            <h3>Many monkeys</h3>
            Chaos Monkey - Latency Monkey - Conformity Monkey - Doctor Monkey - Janitor Monkey - Security Monkey - 10â€“18 Monkey - Chaos Gorilla
          </section>
          <section>
            Chaos Monkey shuts down instances, Chaos Gorilla shuts down whole AZs

            Pro Tip: Do it in a separate AWS account
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h2>Tip #3</h2>
            use more "managed" things, offload HA concerns to AWS
          </section>
          <section>
            where you can,
            <h1>go serverless</h1>
            because API Gateway and Lambdas will be managed, replicated and highly available out of the box :)
